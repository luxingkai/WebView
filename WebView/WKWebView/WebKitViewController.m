     Integrate web content seamlessly into your app, and customize
     content interactions to meet your app's needs.
     
     Use the WebKit framework to integrate richly styled web content
     into your app's native content. WebKit offers a full browsing
     experience for your conntent, offering a platform-native view
     and supporting classes to:
     •  Display rich web content using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
     •  Handle the incremental loading of page content
     •  Display multiple MIME types and compound frame elements
     •  Navigation between pages of content
     •  Manage a forward-back list of recently visited pages
     
     Present a WKWebView object from your custom view hierarchies
     and load the content your want to display. Use supporting
     objects to manage cookies, evaluate scripts, control navigation,
     genarate snapshots, and perform text-based searches.
     
     ⚠️ Always call WebKit functions and methods from your app's
     main thread or main dispatch queue.
